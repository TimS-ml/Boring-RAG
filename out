('down digestible complex carbohydrates to simple sugars, mostly \n'
 'glucose. Glucose is then transported to all our cells where it is \n'
 'stored, used to make energy, or used to build macromolecules. Fiber \n'
 'is also a complex carbohydrate, but it cannot be broken down by \n'
 'digestive enzymes in the human intestine. As a result, it passes \n'
 'through the digestive tract undigested unless the bacteria that \n'
 'inhabit the colon or large intestine break it down. \n'
 'One gram of digestible carbohydrates yields four kilocalories of \n'
 'energy for the cells in the body to perform work. In addition to \n'
 'providing energy and serving as building blocks for bigger \n'
 'macromolecules, carbohydrates are essential for proper functioning \n'
 'of the nervous system, heart, and kidneys. As mentioned, glucose \n'
 'can be stored in the body for future use. In humans, the storage \n'
 'molecule of carbohydrates is called glycogen, and in plants, it is \n'
 'known as starch. Glycogen and starch are complex carbohydrates. \n'
 'Lipids \n'
 'Lipids are also a family of molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, \n'
 'and oxygen, but unlike carbohydrates, they are insoluble in water. \n'
 'Lipids are found predominantly in butter, oils, meats, dairy \n'
 'products, nuts, and seeds, and in many processed foods. The three \n'
 'main \n'
 'types \n'
 'of \n'
 'lipids \n'
 'are \n'
 'triglycerides \n'
 '(triacylglycerols), \n'
 'phospholipids, and sterols. The main job of lipids is to provide or \n'
 'store energy. Lipids provide more energy per gram than \n'
 'carbohydrates (nine kilocalories per gram of lipids versus four \n'
 'kilocalories per gram of carbohydrates). In addition to energy \n'
 'storage, lipids serve as a major component of cell membranes, \n'
 'surround and protect organs (in fat-storing tissues), provide \n'
 'insulation to aid in temperature regulation, and regulate many other \n'
 'functions in the body. \n'
